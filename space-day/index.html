          This project involves mobile exhibition buses that will travel to
          various universities and colleges during National Space Day
          celebrations. On January 24, 2023, ISRO signed a Memorandum of
          Understanding (MoU) with a prominent science organisation Vijnana
          Bharati (VIBHA), which is dedicated to promoting scientific knowledge
          and awareness, to collaborate on a unique initiative called “Space on
          Wheels.”<br />
          <br />

          The primary goal of this initiative is to disseminate information
          about ISRO’s activities and India’s space missions to school students
          across all states of India. This collaboration represents a joint
          effort between VIBHA and ISRO to enhance public understanding of space
          science and foster greater interest in space exploration.

          <strong>ISRO Space Tutors: Engaging and Educating</strong>
        </label>
        <hr style="margin: 0px" />

        <p style="font-size: x-large">
          Space Tutors are educators and mentors registered with ISRO who are
          dedicated to advancing space science and technology education. They
          play a crucial role in engaging students and the public through
          various outreach activities. In response to the evolving educational
          landscape, ISRO is committed to disseminating enriched knowledge in
          the space domain. <br />
          <br />

          To support this, numerous NGOs and educational institutions have
          developed frameworks that encourage students to register and explore
          space science and technology. These frameworks include educational
          modules with books and lab work that complement regular classroom
          learning. Additionally, digital content creators and online educators
          use social media and mobile applications to offer virtual learning
          experiences. <br />
          <br />
          ISRO's 120 registered Space Tutors will organize outreach events such
          as talks, quizzes, and exhibitions across the country, aiming to
          promote space education and raise awareness about space activities and
          applications. They will receive support through promotional materials
          to enhance their efforts in fostering scientific curiosity and
          innovative thinking among students.
